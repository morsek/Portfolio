
My name is Kristen Morse. I am a current student at Mansfield University. I am majoring in Computer Information Systems and minoring in Marketing. I enjoy coding and working on group projects. I have made a few websites in previous classes and worked on them over time. My favorite website that I have made so far would be my Sneaker Collection. I am currently working on a few group projects in one of my classes this semester. We have been working a lot with Amazon's AWS feature creating servers.
