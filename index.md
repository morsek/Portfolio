
My name is Kristen Morse. I am a current student at Mansfield University. I am majoring in Computer Information Systems and minoring in Marketing. I enjoy coding and working on group projects. I have made a few websites in previous classes and worked on them over time. My favorite website that I have made so far would be my Sneaker Collection. I am currently working on a few group projects in one of my classes this semester. We have been working a lot with Amazon's AWS feature creating servers.

# Group Project

* Computer Database Java Program: [Click Here](https://github.com/Team-Juan/group_project) - This is a java based program that collects, modifies, and displays information about computer systems. Some values include, the make, model, and specifications of the computer system. You can view the Java documentation [here](https://team-juan.github.io/group_project/index.html). The program also features a JUnit testing application.

### Bulletin Board

* I created a bulletin board in my CIS 2206 class. My group members researched the information. I researched three of the codes listed on the board and designed the board. I picked the color scheme, design of the information and the backgrounds for the information. I also added photos of the codes running so people could see what it looked like.
