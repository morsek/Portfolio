I enjoy coding and working on group projects. I have made a few websites in previous classes and worked on them over time. My favorite website that I have made so far would be my Sneaker Collection. I am currently working on a few group projects in one of my classes this semester. We have been working a lot with Amazon's AWS feature creating servers.\r\n\r\n[Click Here] for my resume (file:///G:/CIS%20Classes/CIS%20-%202206/CIS%202206/Online%20Morse%20Resume.pdf)\r\n\r\n## **Code Repository**\r\n\r\n* AWS Shell Script: [Click Here](https://github.com/morsek/awsshellscripts)\r\n* AWS Shell Script 2: [Click Here](https://github.com/morsek/awsshellscripts2)\r\n* Employee Data Base: [Click Here](https://github.com/morsek/s2employeedb)\r\n* Simple Java Database Program: [Click Here](https://github.com/Team-Juan/simple_java_program)\r\n* Group Database Java Program: [Click Here](https://github.com/Team-Juan/group_project)\r\n+ User Guides: [Click Here](https://github.com/Team-Juan/user-guides/wiki)\r\n\r\n# Group Project\r\n\r\n* Computer Database Java Program: [Click Here](https://github.com/Team-Juan/group_project) - This is a java based program that collects, modifies, and displays information about computer systems.

The Trello board will also display all of the work that we have finished in previous weeks along with all of the information that we are currently working on.\r\n\r\n![trello](https://team-juan.github.io/team-portfolio/images/trello.JPG)\r\n\r\n### Bulletin Board\r\n\r\n* I created a bulletin board in my CIS 2206 class. My group members researched the information. I researched three of the codes listed on the board and designed the board. I picked the color scheme, design of the information and the backgrounds for the information. I also added photos of the codes running so people could see what it looked like.\r\n\r\n![board](https://team-juan.github.io/team-portfolio/images/photo.jpg)\r\n\r\n* CODEography bulletin board - A biography of various and some obscure programming languages. Some including the famous \"hello world\" examples.",
